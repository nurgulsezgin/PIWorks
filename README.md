# P.I Works

Please implement a function/program to check if a number is divisible by sum of its digits.

E.g.

a) is_divisible(75) ➞ False

7+5=12

75 is NOT divisible by 12 (result: 6.25)

b) is_divisible(171) ➞ True

1+7+1=9

171 is divisible by 9 (result: 19)

c) is_divisible(481) ➞ True

4+8+1 = 13

481 is divisible by 13 (result: 37)

Please paste the code snippet here (not the link itself please) that was implemented or tested using pastebin, github, coderpad.io, dotnetfiddle, jsfiddle, or any other public website.

Please write the code in any language (preferred language is C#) or pseudo code will also be evaluated.

Example Input:

75

The function to implement:

is_divisible (input)

Example Output:

False
